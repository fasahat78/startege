## Potential Concerns & Mitigation

### ⚠️ Concern 1: "Could Startegizer replace IBM consulting?"

**Answer:** No. They serve fundamentally different purposes:
- Startegizer teaches individuals about AI governance concepts
- IBM Consulting implements enterprise governance programs
- One is educational, the other is transformational
- Different scales, different outcomes, different markets

**Mitigation:** Clear positioning - Startegizer is explicitly educational/training focused, not a consulting replacement.

### ⚠️ Concern 2: "Could users learn from Startegizer and skip IBM consulting?"

**Answer:** Unlikely. These are complementary, not competitive:
- Startegizer helps individuals learn concepts
- IBM Consulting helps organizations implement governance
- Learning ≠ Implementation
- Individual knowledge ≠ Organizational transformation

**Mitigation:** Startegizer explicitly focuses on certification prep and learning, not implementation guidance.

### ⚠️ Concern 3: "Does Startegizer use IBM proprietary knowledge?"

**Answer:** No. Startegizer uses:
- Public domain AIGP certification materials
- Publicly available regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, GDPR, NIST)
- Industry-standard best practices (publicly documented)
- No IBM proprietary frameworks or methodologies

**Mitigation:** Content is clearly sourced from public materials only.
