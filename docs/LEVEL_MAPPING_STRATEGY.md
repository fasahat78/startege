## Concept Selection Algorithm

### For Each Level:

1. **Identify Level Range** (1-10, 11-20, etc.)
2. **Select Concepts**:
   - 40% from primary domain for this range
   - 30% from secondary domain
   - 20% from tertiary domain
   - 10% bonus/advanced concepts
3. **Ensure Coverage**:
   - No concept repeated in same level
   - Important concepts appear in multiple levels (with increasing depth)
4. **Balance Difficulty**:
   - Mix beginner/intermediate/advanced within level
   - Progressive difficulty across levels

## Implementation Notes

### Concept Assignment Process
1. **Categorize** all 410 concepts by domain and difficulty
2. **Map** to level ranges based on difficulty
3. **Distribute** evenly across levels within range
4. **Validate** coverage (all concepts included)
5. **Review** progression (logical flow)

### Dynamic Assignment (Future)
- AI analyzes concept relationships
- Suggests optimal level assignments
- Adjusts based on user performance data
