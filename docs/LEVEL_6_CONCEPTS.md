3. **Prohibited AI Practices**
   - Defines AI uses that are outright banned
   - Spiral learning: Levels 6, 15, 30

4. **High-Risk AI Systems (Conceptual Overview)**
   - Introduces high-risk category without obligations
   - Spiral learning: Levels 6, 15, 30

5. **Limited-Risk AI Systems and Transparency Obligations**
   - Introduces disclosure logic for certain AI uses
   - Spiral learning: Levels 6, 8, 15

6. **Minimal-Risk AI Systems**
   - Prevents over-regulation misunderstandings
   - No spiral learning

7. **Relationship Between the AI Act and Other Laws**
   - Clarifies interaction with GDPR and other laws
   - Spiral learning: Levels 6, 12, 22

### Practiced Governance Concepts (3 concepts)

8. **AI Governance Implications of Risk Classification**
   - Connects AI Act risk tiers to governance design
   - Spiral learning: Levels 6, 7, 26
   - Category: AI Lifecycle Governance

9. **Organisational Responsibility under the AI Act**
   - Reinforces organisational accountability under regulation
   - Spiral learning: Levels 6, 9, 18
   - Category: Governance Structures & Roles

10. **Lifecycle Thinking in AI Regulation**
    - Aligns regulatory thinking with AI lifecycle governance
    - Spiral learning: Levels 6, 7, 27
    - Category: AI Lifecycle Governance

## Pruned Concepts

The following concepts were considered but pruned:

- **Conformity Assessments** — Operational detail — belongs later
- **AI Act Enforcement Bodies** — Better in Enforcement Mechanisms
- **Foundation Models and GPAI** — Emerging detail; better later
- **Penalties under the AI Act** — Enforcement comes later

## CSV File

The concepts are stored in `data/level-6-concepts.csv` and ready for import:

```bash
npm run import:level-mapping data/level-6-concepts.csv
```

## Validation Notes

✅ **First exposure to AI-specific regulation**  
✅ **Strong conceptual clarity**  
✅ **No premature compliance detail**  
✅ **Clean setup for Levels 7, 13, and 15**

## Next Steps

After importing Level 6 concepts:
1. Verify category assignment
2. Verify LevelCategoryCoverage enforcement
3. Continue with Level 7 concepts generation
