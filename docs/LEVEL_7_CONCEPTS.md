# Level 7 — Risk Management

## Overview

**Super Level:** Foundation  
**Difficulty target:** Beginner → early Intermediate  
**Primary intent:** Introduce an AI governance risk mindset: identify risks, classify them, and connect them to controls — without going deep into impact assessments yet.

## Category Coverage

### INTRODUCED
- **D3 — Risk Identification & Assessment**
- **D4 — Operational Monitoring & Controls**

### PRACTICED
- **D2 — AI-Specific Regulation**
- **D3 — Data Governance & Management**

## Design Constraints

- No DPIA/AIA mechanics yet (Level 14)
- No advanced validation/TEVV yet
- Keep risk taxonomy practical: what can go wrong + how governance responds

## Final Level 7 Concepts (10)

### Domain 3 — Risk Identification & Assessment

1. **AI Risk vs Traditional IT Risk**
   - Frames why AI risk requires distinct governance treatment
   - Spiral: 7, 27, 33

2. **Risk-Based Governance Lifecycle (Identify → Assess → Treat → Monitor)**
   - Introduces repeatable governance risk loop
   - Spiral: 7, 27, 31

3. **Risk Taxonomy for AI (Privacy, Bias, Safety, Security, Performance, Legal)**
   - Provides practical AI risk categories used across governance
   - Spiral: 7, 17, 33

4. **Likelihood vs Impact (Risk Scoring Basics)**
   - Introduces basic assessment and prioritisation logic
   - Spiral: 7, 14, 27

5. **Residual Risk and Risk Acceptance**
   - Introduces risk acceptance and residual risk concept
   - Spiral: 7, 27, 35

6. **Risk Owners and Accountability in Risk Management**
   - Connects risk to ownership and governance accountability
   - Spiral: 7, 9, 26

### Domain 4 — Operational Monitoring & Controls

7. **Why Monitoring Is Part of Governance**
   - Positions monitoring as ongoing governance activity
   - Spiral: 7, 21, 39

8. **Key AI Monitoring Signals (Drift, Errors, Complaints, Incidents)**
   - Introduces practical monitoring indicators without technical depth
   - Spiral: 7, 21, 37

9. **Controls vs Monitoring vs Audit (High-level Distinctions)**
   - Clarifies governance assurance concepts at a high level
   - Spiral: 7, 16, 37

### Practiced Bridge

10. **Risk Classification under the EU AI Act (Conceptual)**
    - Bridges AI Act risk tiers into governance risk thinking
    - Spiral: 7, 15, 30

## Pruning Logic

**Pruned concepts:**
- Threat Modeling for AI Systems (too security-specific)
- Quantitative Risk Models (too advanced)
- Formal Risk Registers and Templates (too procedural)

## Progression Notes

- ✅ Introduces two new categories cleanly
- ✅ Connects AI Act risk framing with governance risk
- ✅ Sets up Transparency (L8), Accountability (L9), and Impact Assessments (L14)
- ✅ No premature TEVV / DPIA depth
