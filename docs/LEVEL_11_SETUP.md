### Missing Concepts (Need to be Created)
1. ❌ **Users Subjects and Affected Stakeholders**
   - Expected: Concept about identifying users, subjects, and affected stakeholders in AI use cases

## Next Steps

1. **Create Missing Concepts**: The 2 missing concepts need to be created in the database
2. **Verify Concept Matches**: Review the 8 assigned concepts to ensure they match the intended Level 11 concepts
3. **Update Concept Names**: If concepts exist with different names, update the script to use the correct names
