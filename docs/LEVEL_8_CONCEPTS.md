# Level 8 — Transparency

## Overview

**Super Level:** Foundation  
**Difficulty target:** Beginner → early Intermediate  
**Primary intent:** Introduce transparency as a governance obligation, focusing on communication, documentation, and disclosure — not model internals.

## Category Coverage

### INTRODUCED
- **D4 — Transparency & Communication**
- **D3 — Documentation & Record-Keeping**

### PRACTICED
- **D1 — Policies & Standards (Internal)**
- **D1 — AI Lifecycle Governance**

## Design Constraints

- No technical explainability (SHAP, LIME, etc.)
- No audit evidence yet (that's later)
- Focus on who needs to know what, when, and why

## Final Level 8 Concepts (10)

### Domain 4 — Transparency & Communication

1. **Purpose of Transparency in AI Governance**
   - Frames transparency as a governance and trust mechanism
   - Spiral: 8, 17, 39

2. **Transparency vs Explainability (Conceptual Distinction)**
   - Prevents early technical explainability drift
   - Spiral: 8, 17, 36

3. **Stakeholders of AI Transparency**
   - Anchors transparency obligations to audience needs
   - Spiral: 8, 18, 39

4. **User-Facing Transparency for AI Systems**
   - Introduces disclosure expectations for users
   - Spiral: 8, 15, 36

5. **Internal Transparency for Decision-Makers**
   - Enables governance oversight and accountability
   - Spiral: 8, 26, 35

6. **Transparency Trade-offs (Clarity vs Complexity vs Risk)**
   - Introduces judgement in transparency decisions
   - Spiral: 8, 28, 39

### Domain 3 — Documentation & Record-Keeping

7. **Why Documentation Is a Governance Control**
   - Positions documentation as active governance control
   - Spiral: 8, 16, 37

8. **Types of AI Governance Documentation**
   - Introduces common governance artefacts
   - Spiral: 8, 16, 37

9. **Documentation Across the AI Lifecycle**
   - Aligns documentation with lifecycle governance
   - Spiral: 8, 16, 37

10. **Record-Keeping vs Knowledge Sharing**
    - Clarifies different documentation purposes
    - Spiral: 8, 26, 37

## Pruning Logic

**Pruned concepts:**
- Model Cards and Fact Sheets (specific artefacts fit better later)
- Right to Explanation (legally complex; overlaps with Privacy Rights)
- Disclosure Templates (procedural detail too early)
- Audit Logs (audit belongs later)

## Progression Notes

- ✅ Clean introduction of two new categories
- ✅ No technical or audit drift
- ✅ Strong linkage to Accountability (Level 9) and Compliance (later)
- ✅ Aligned with governance-first thinking
