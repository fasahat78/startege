# Level 9 — Accountability

## Overview

**Super Level:** Foundation  
**Difficulty target:** Early → solid Intermediate  
**Primary intent:** Make accountability operational and enforceable — not just a principle. Learners should clearly understand who is accountable, for what, when, and how issues are escalated.

## Category Coverage

### INTRODUCED
- **D1 — Decision-Making & Escalation**
- **D4 — Incident & Issue Management**

### PRACTICED
- **D3 — Risk Identification & Assessment**
- **D4 — Transparency & Communication**

## Design Constraints

- No audit assurance yet (Level 16)
- No enforcement/penalties yet (Level 18)
- Focus on internal accountability mechanics

## Final Level 9 Concepts (10)

### Domain 1 — Decision-Making & Escalation

1. **Accountability vs Responsibility vs Authority**
   - Clarifies critical governance distinctions before escalation logic
   - Spiral: 9, 16, 31

2. **Decision Rights in AI Governance**
   - Defines who can approve, stop, or escalate AI use
   - Spiral: 9, 26, 35

3. **Escalation Triggers in AI Systems**
   - Identifies when AI issues must be escalated
   - Spiral: 9, 18, 35

4. **Risk-Based Decision-Making in AI Governance**
   - Connects risk assessment to governance decisions
   - Spiral: 9, 27, 35

5. **Governance Forums and Committees**
   - Introduces formal governance decision bodies
   - Spiral: 9, 26, 35

6. **Documenting Decisions and Rationale**
   - Links accountability to transparency and records
   - Spiral: 9, 16, 37

### Domain 4 — Incident & Issue Management

7. **What Constitutes an AI Incident**
   - Defines boundary for incident handling
   - Spiral: 9, 18, 37

8. **Incidents vs Issues vs Defects**
   - Prevents misclassification and mis-escalation
   - Spiral: 9, 18, 37

9. **Incident Response Roles and Responsibilities**
   - Reinforces accountability during AI failures
   - Spiral: 9, 18, 26

10. **Communication During AI Incidents**
    - Connects incident handling to transparency obligations
    - Spiral: 9, 18, 39

## Pruning Logic

**Pruned concepts:**
- Root Cause Analysis Techniques (method-heavy; better later)
- Regulatory Notification of Incidents (enforcement belongs later)
- Post-Incident Reviews (fits better with audit & assurance)
- Crisis Management for AI Failures (too advanced for Foundation)

## Progression Notes

- ✅ Introduces final Foundation categories
- ✅ Integrates risk + transparency + governance
- ✅ Perfect setup for Level 10 Boss
- ✅ No enforcement or audit drift
